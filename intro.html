    <p class="subT">Origin</p>
    <p>Ukiyo-e (浮世絵) is a style of Japanese woodblock prints which flourished during the Edo Period (1603-1867). They originated as popular culture in Edo (present-day Tokyo). Meaning "Pictures of the Floating World," it describes the sensory pleasures of urban life but also offers a bittersweet reminder of the fleeting nature of all worldly delights.<br>

When ukiyo-e first emerged in the late sixteenth century, it usually depicted common people and their social life. It wasn't until the eighteenth century that ukiyo-e became a popular art form, thanks partly to advances in woodblock printing techniques. Subjects like kabuki actors, prostitutes, and characters in classic stories came to be depicted around this time. Also, Ukiyo-e serves as advertising illustrations by young artists were widely circulated. These factors helped ukiyo-e become a part of Japan's pop culture.

                <p class="description">Hishikawa Moronobu is known as the first Ukiyo-e artist. He created the first ukiyo-e in woodblock print after drawing illustrations in books for years. His large number of works in the form of one-piece black-ink only prints and drawings done by hand resulted in a foundation for future ukiyo-e development.</p>

                <p class="description">Suzuki Harunobu is famous for his invention of full-color prints (nishiki-e) in 1765. Like many ukiyo-e artists of his day, he produced a number of shunga, or erotic images, but he was proficient in an elegant style of depicting young girls. Richard Lane describes his style as "Harunobu's special province, one in which he surpassed all other Japanese artists - eternal girlhood in unusual and poetic settings".</p>

To Muneshige Narazaki, Sharaku was able "to depict, within a single print, two or three levels of character revealed in the single moment of action forming the climax to a scene or performance".</p>

                <p class="description">Hokusai is best known for his woodblock print series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. This series, specifically The Great Wave print and Fine Wind, Clear Morning, made Hokusai famous both in Japan and overseas. Besides his success in landscape painting, Hokusai worked in various fields such as book illustrations. Hokusai's last words were recorded as follows: "If heaven will extend my life by ten more years…If heaven will afford me five more years of life, then I'll manage to become a true artist."</p>

    <p class="subT">Ending</p>
    <p class="last">Following the deaths of Hokusai and Hiroshige and the Meiji Restoration of 1868, ukiyo-e suffered a sharp decline in quantity and quality. Woodblock printing became more westernized, started to depict current events, served for journalism, and faced competition from photography. Artists continued to produce occasional remarkable works, but by the 1890s, the tradition was dying. In 1915, publisher Shōzaburō Watanabe introduced the term 'shin-hanga' ("new prints") to describe a style of prints that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences.The printing making goes on, but ukiyo-e has come to an end.
